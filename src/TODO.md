- add icons
- add remaining projections
- test all projections
- unit tests possible? visual tests?
- DRY up scale factors if possible
- antialiasing -- sample multiple pixels near source pixel and weight them accordingly?
- look into other projections not from xkcd
- manually clean up `reproject` cause it looks kinda fishy
