- add icons
- add remaining projections
- add globe projection based on webgl
- test all projections
- unit tests possible? visual tests?
- look into other projections not from xkcd
- manually clean up `reproject` cause it looks kinda fishy
- fix revert icon
- each projection should just have a known aspect ratio you can hardcode, or at least, calculate with only one or two inversions -- use that instead of ridiculous sampling
